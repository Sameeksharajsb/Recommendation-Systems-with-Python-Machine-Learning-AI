# Recommendation-Systems-with-Python-Machine-Learning-AI
## Introduction 
This is a project that builds Classification-based, Model-based Collaborative filtering systems and Content-based recommender systems. At the end I also evaluate which recommender performed the best
## Recommender Systems
**1** Classification-based Collaborative Filtering Systems  
File:<code> Classification_based_collaborative_filtering.ipynb</code> - a notebook that demonstrates how calssification based collaberative filtering works powered by Logistic Regression classifier   
**2.** Content-Based Recommender Systems  
3. File: <code> Content based recommender systems.ipynb</code> - a notebook that demonstrates how content based recommender system works powered by Nearest Neighbor Algo
