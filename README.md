# Recommendation-Systems-with-Python-Machine-Learning-AI
## Introduction 
This is a project that builds recommender systems: Classification-based, Model-based Collaborative filtering systems and Content-based recommender systems. At the end I also evaluate which recommender performed the best

## Data
1. Bank Marketing Data for Classification-based CF: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#
2. MovieLens Data for Model-based CF:  https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
3. mtcars Data for Content-based recommender: mtcars dataset source: Henderson and Velleman (1981), Building multiple regression models interactively. Biometrics, 37, 391â€“411.

## Recommender Systems
**1.**  Classification-based Collaborative Filtering Systems  

File: <code>Classification_based_collaborative_filtering.ipynb</code> - a notebook that demonstrates how calssification-based CF works powered by Logistic Regression classifier   

**2.**  Model-Based Collaborative Filtering Systems  

File: <code>Model-based collaborative filtering.ipynb</code> - a notebook that demonstrates how model-based CF works powered by SVD Matrix Factorization 

**3.**  Content-Based Recommender Systems  

File: <code>Content based recommender systems.ipynb</code> - a notebook that demonstrates how content based recommender system works powered by Nearest Neighbor Algo
